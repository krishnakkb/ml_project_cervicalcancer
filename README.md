What is cervical cancer?
Cervical cancer is a malignant tumour starting in the cells of a womanâ€™s cervix, and possibly spreading or metastasizing to other parts of her body.

About 11,000 new cases of invasive cervical cancer are diagnosed each year in the U.S.

Although the number of cases of cervical cancer have been declining in recent years due to more advanced screening and early detection with the Pap test, 300,000 women worldwide die each year due to cervical cancer.
